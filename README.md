# TriviaGame

Hello, and welcome to my Family Guy trivia game! I wanted to create an advanced trivia game that gives the user each question, one at a time, and gives the user 30 seconds to solve the question.
I also wanted the correct answer to be displayed if the wrong answer is selected, and a counter to hold all the correct and incorrect answers, as well as, any questions left unanswered. 

My first step was to build the basic html layout, there isnt going to be very much to the HTML page, as we will dynamically add everthing using jquery and javascript.
